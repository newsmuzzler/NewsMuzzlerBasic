# NewsMuzzler
***NewsMuzzler*** is an application built on the Prifina platform that will give the user some form of privacy with and control over their data. 

With NewsMuzzler, this is done by creating anonymous emails that will be used to receive email newsletters that the user does not want to be linked to their actual email accounts. Therefore, the goal of this application is to make it as simple as possible to create new anonymous emails and read the resulting newsletters in a way that is well formatted for reading. It can also serve as a centralized hub for the user's newsletters, making it easier for the user to access their subscriptions and remove newsletters that they no longer are interested in.

As of time of development the back-end necessary has not been fully developed, so this is solely an example application with usable UI, not a fully functional project. This is also an early prototype, so there will be more work done on making the application look better and have more helpful features.
